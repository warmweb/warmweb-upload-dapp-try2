# Filecoin Synapse dApp Tutorial

This repo will serve with tutorial to demonstrate how to build a decentralized application (dApp) that interacts with Filecoin Synapse - a smart-contract based marketplace for storage and other services in the Filecoin ecosystem.

## Overview

This dApp showcases:
- Connecting to Filecoin networks (Mainnet/Calibration)
- Installing synapse-sdk to your project.
- Depositing funds to Synapse contracts using USDFC token.
- Uploading files to Filecoin through Synapse
- **NEW:** Site Gen (Synapse) - Generate static websites and store them on Filecoin

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- A web3 wallet (like MetaMask)
- Basic understanding of React and TypeScript
- Get some tFIL tokens on Filecoin Calibration testnet [link to faucet](https://faucet.calibnet.chainsafe-fil.io/funds.html)
- Get some USDFC tokens on Filecoin Calibration testnet [link to faucet](https://forest-explorer.chainsafe.dev/faucet/calibnet_usdfc)

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fs-upload-app
cd fs-upload-app
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Configure environment variables (optional):
```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```
Edit `.env.local` to customize the WarmWeb server URL if needed:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_WARMWEB_SERVER_URL=https://warmweb.xyz
```

4. Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the dApp.

## Key Components

### Wallet Connection
The dApp uses RainbowKit for seamless wallet connection, configured specifically for Filecoin networks:
- Filecoin Mainnet
- Filecoin Calibration (testnet)

### Query token and storage usage Balances
Shows how to:
- Get user FIL-USDFC-SynapseStorageUsage balances
- hook used to query user balances [link](https://github.com/FIL-Builders/fs-upload-dapp/blob/main/hooks/useBalances.ts)

### Pay For Storage with USDFC
Demonstrates how to:
- Pay for storage by depositing funds to Synapse contracts using USDFC token
- Handles one time payment for 10GB usage that persists 30days
- Notifies repayment if less than 10days remain for paying synapse based on current usage
- hook used to conduct a payment [link](https://github.com/FIL-Builders/fs-upload-dapp/blob/main/hooks/usePayment.ts)

### File Upload
Shows how to:
- Create a user-friendly file upload interface
- Upload file to Filecoin using synapse-sdk
- Monitor upload status
- Download filecoin from Filecoin using synapse-sdk
- hook used to upload a file [link](https://github.com/FIL-Builders/fs-upload-dapp/blob/main/hooks/useFileUpload.ts)

## Site Gen (Synapse) Demo

**NEW FEATURE**: The dApp now includes a site generator that creates static websites from text prompts and stores them on Filecoin via Synapse Warm Storage.

### Quick Start Flow

1. **Connect Wallet** ‚Üí Use RainbowKit to connect to Filecoin Calibration testnet
2. **Navigate** ‚Üí Go to `/site-gen` in the app
3. **Generate Site** ‚Üí Enter a text prompt describing your website ‚Üí Click "Build Preview"
4. **Setup Storage** (first-time users only):
   - Deposit USDFC: Click "Deposit USDFC" button (requires 5+ USDFC)
   - Approve Warm Storage: Click "Approve Warm Storage" button
5. **Store with Synapse** ‚Üí Click "Store with Synapse" ‚Üí Copy the returned PieceCID
6. **Verify Artifact** (optional) ‚Üí Click "Download ZIP" to get the exact file stored on Filecoin

### Requirements

- **tFIL tokens** for gas fees (‚â•0.1 tFIL) ‚Üí [Get tFIL](https://faucet.calibnet.chainsafe-fil.io/funds.html)
- **USDFC tokens** for storage fees (‚â•5 USDFC) ‚Üí [Get USDFC](https://forest-explorer.chainsafe.dev/faucet/calibnet_usdfc)

### Features

#### üìã Smart Checklist
The app shows a real-time checklist of upload requirements:
- ‚úÖ Wallet connected (Calibration)
- ‚úÖ tFIL for fees present (‚â•0.1)
- ‚úÖ USDFC ‚â•5 deposited
- ‚úÖ Warm Storage approved (rate + lockup)
- ‚úÖ Ready to upload

#### üîß One-Click Fixes
Missing requirements show "Fix" buttons:
- **"Deposit USDFC"** ‚Üí Automatically deposits 5 USDFC to Synapse
- **"Approve Warm Storage"** ‚Üí Sets up rate and lockup allowances
- **"Get tFIL"** ‚Üí Direct link to Calibration faucet

#### üì¶ Artifact Transparency
- **Server-side ZIP generation** ensures consistency
- **Download ZIP** provides the exact artifact stored on Filecoin
- **File structure**: `index.html` + `assets/main.js` (boot script)

#### üêõ Debug Mode (Development)
In development mode, a collapsible debug section shows:
- Current network and signer address
- Real-time balances and allowances
- Upload payload size and status
- Raw debug object for troubleshooting

### Technical Implementation

The Site Gen feature demonstrates:
- **Text-to-HTML generation** with embedded CSS and Filecoin branding
- **ZIP artifact creation** using JSZip (client + server-side)
- **Synapse Warm Storage integration** with robust error handling
- **Pre-flight checks** for balances, deposits, and allowances
- **Network-aware token handling** (tFIL vs FIL, testnet vs mainnet)
- **Progressive enhancement** with fallbacks and user guidance

### Storage Process

1. **HTML Generation** ‚Üí Creates responsive website from user prompt
2. **ZIP Creation** ‚Üí Packages HTML + JavaScript boot script
3. **Balance Checks** ‚Üí Verifies tFIL for gas and USDFC for storage
4. **Allowance Setup** ‚Üí Ensures Warm Storage permissions (first-time only)
5. **Filecoin Upload** ‚Üí Stores ZIP via Synapse with progress tracking
6. **PieceCID Return** ‚Üí Provides unique identifier for retrieval

### Error Handling

The app provides human-readable error messages:
- **"Insufficient tFIL for gas fees"** ‚Üí Links to faucet
- **"USDFC deposit needed"** ‚Üí Shows fix button
- **"Warm Storage not approved"** ‚Üí Guides through approval
- **"Network not supported"** ‚Üí Suggests switching to Calibration

### Notes

- **Filecoin Calibration testnet only** (mainnet support can be enabled)
- **First-time setup required** for USDFC deposit and Warm Storage approval
- **Gas fees paid in tFIL**, storage fees paid in USDFC
- **IPFS upload is separate** and not part of this Synapse-first flow
- **Artifact verification** ensures transparency of stored content
