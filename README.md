# Filecoin Synapse dApp Tutorial

This repo will serve with tutorial to demonstrate how to build a decentralized application (dApp) that interacts with Filecoin Synapse - a smart-contract based marketplace for storage and other services in the Filecoin ecosystem.

## Overview

This dApp showcases:
- Connecting to Filecoin networks (Mainnet/Calibration)
- Installing synapse-sdk to your project.
- Depositing funds to Synapse contracts using USDFC token.
- Uploading files to Filecoin through Synapse

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- A web3 wallet (like MetaMask)
- Basic understanding of React and TypeScript
- Get some tFIL tokens on Filecoin Calibration testnet [link to faucet](https://faucet.calibnet.chainsafe-fil.io/funds.html)
- Get some USDFC tokens on Filecoin Calibration testnet [link to faucet](https://forest-explorer.chainsafe.dev/faucet/calibnet_usdfc)

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fs-upload-app
cd fs-upload-app
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the dApp.

## Key Components

### Wallet Connection
The dApp uses RainbowKit for seamless wallet connection, configured specifically for Filecoin networks:
- Filecoin Mainnet
- Filecoin Calibration (testnet)

### Query token and storage usage Balances
Shows how to:
- Get user FIL-USDFC-SynapseStorageUsage balances
- hook used to query user balances [link](https://github.com/FIL-Builders/fs-upload-dapp/blob/main/hooks/useBalances.ts)

### Pay For Storage with USDFC
Demonstrates how to:
- Pay for storage by depositing funds to Synapse contracts using USDFC token
- Handles one time payment for 10GB usage that persists 30days
- Notifies repayment if less than 10days remain for paying synapse based on current usage
- hook used to conduct a payment [link](https://github.com/FIL-Builders/fs-upload-dapp/blob/main/hooks/usePayment.ts)

### File Upload
Shows how to:
- Create a user-friendly file upload interface
- Upload file to Filecoin using synapse-sdk
- Monitor upload status
- Download filecoin from Filecoin using synapse-sdk
- hook used to upload a file [link](https://github.com/FIL-Builders/fs-upload-dapp/blob/main/hooks/useFileUpload.ts)
